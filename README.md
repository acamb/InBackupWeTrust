# InBackupWeTrust
A simple backup system with Google drive integration

In order to use this application you need to create an oauth2 client id key from your google developer console and copy the client_id.json in ~/.credentials/InBackupWeTrust .
The first run requires user interaction to authorize the application, from that point you can run headless (copy .credentials if you plan to run on another machine headless).

## First run and config file
An example config file will be created in the default location ([user_home]/ibwt.cfg) if none is fond (or none specified and the default doesn't exist)
